        This document is meant to be used as a guide to the recovery process for Homa Enterprises Limited. The recovery process will include a review of current state and carrying out a SWOT analysis to guide on the forward Business
        Plan and as well develop a forward business plan that will ensure the business recovers and operates as an independent company.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        The forward Plan will cover a period of two years within which it will be expected to have recovered but can be reviewed periodically based on the actual
        state of the business. This plan will have to be followed to the letter to ensure successful recovery and structured operations.

        	From this review, the Company having been registered in the year 2013, by 2019 has no tangible asset. This is because the company has not been stable in business and even in cases where the company had obtained orders from Kenya Airways, it has never been structured therefor the company has never
        been earning any income.  The Money gets into the company and leaves without proper accounting, structured plan or documentation.
    </p>
    <p class="text-justify">
        	The Company has an account with Kenya Cooperative Bank but has no cash in the account. The account is somehow
        dormant. This is due zero cash flow caused by lack of businesses. This means that the company has Zero Capital to use as it recovers.
